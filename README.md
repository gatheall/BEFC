## Introduction

This repository holds items that I created for the [Bald Eagle Flying Club](https://www.baldeagleflyingclub.org/).

* [calculate-plane-utilization.py](calculate-plane-utilization.py) - a Python script to calculate plane utilization rates based on exports of the `Flights / Check-ins` report in [Flight Circle](https://www.flightcircle.com/).
* [checklists/](checklists/README.md) - a handful of Foreflight checklists for the planes I fly or have flown.
