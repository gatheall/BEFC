## Introduction

Included here are checklists for ForeFlight that I created for the [Bald
Eagle Flying Club](https://www.baldeagleflyingclub.org/) :

* [N4818D](N4818D.fmd), for a 1979 Cessna 172N with a Skyview HDX panel
(including 2 axis autopilot), Garmin GTN650, Superhawk STC 180-hp
Penn-Yan conversion, and STOL kit. 
* [N4647R](N4647R.fmd), for a 2015 Vans RV-12 with a Skyview panel 
(including 2 axis autopilot).
* [N8181N](N8181N.fmd), for a 1968 Piper Cherokee PA-28-140.

They also have some content that's customized to the club, such as our
use of [Flight Circle](https://www.flightcircle.com/) for scheduling as
well as locations where the planes are based. 


## Installation

To install a checklist into your copy of ForeFlight
Checklists, you can either : 

* Use AirDrop
* Email it to yourself as an attachment, view it using the mail app
on your iPad or iPhone, and then open the attachment in ForeFlight.


## Updates

If you find mistakes or want to suggest improvements, please raise an
issue or submit a pull request.  Note, though, that changes should be
specific to Bald Eagle's fleet.
